**COVAS: Collision Avoidance and Vehicle Automation System using CAN Protocol**

This project is about creating an automatic braking system and providing real-time monitoring for vehicles using the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol for communication. The system is designed to improve vehicle safety by detecting potential collision risks and automating the braking process, while also enabling reliable data exchange between different vehicle subsystems.
